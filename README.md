Shoji is a fisherman.  For his job, he leaves traps on the seafloor to catch his fish.  He drops the traps in a particular location with a floating buoy.  Most of the traps need to be checked every other day, but some of them need to be checked every 3 or 4 days.  Shoji would like some help keeping track of his traps, and would also like to learn which traps are doing better than others.  He would like to:
* Be able to create a new trap by entering a latitude and longitude
* By default be reminded to check the trap in 2 days
* Be able to print a list of traps to be checked
* Record how many fish were caught in a trap
* Print traps sorted by how many fish they caught
* Change the frequency of checking traps

If you want to get really fancy, try making something that will help Shoji find the most efficient route to check his traps in.
